# NAME:          lsb.reasons
#
# PURPOSE:       Configure a custom pending reason message and
# pending reason priority for a resource.
#
# DESCRIPTION:   This file allows LSF administrators to configure and simplify a 
# pending reason message. This file also allows LSF administrators
# to configure the resource priority. If a job is pending due to the 
# unavailability of multiple resources (with different resources and different 
# hosts), the host lacking the resource configured with highest priority 
# will be selected as the single pending reason.
#
# This file contains one or more CustomPendingReason sections.
# After editing this file, run "badmin reconfig" to apply your changes.
#
# ********************************************************************
#
# CustomPendingReason section
# ---------------------------
#
# Each set of configured pending reason messages are defined in a 
# CustomPendingReason section enclosed by Begin CustomPendingReason 
# and End CustomPendingReason.
#
# Format:
# CustomPendingReason sections can be configured in either horizontal
# or vertical format (using multiple lines). In the case of an error 
# within the section, the entire section will be ignored in 
# horizontal format or only the problem line will be ignored in
# vertical format.
#
# Parameters:
# CustomPendingReason sections may have the following parameters:
#
# REASON_ID is a list of pending reason IDs. All corresponding
# messages for pending reason IDs in this list are replaced by the
# specified message. This field must consist of one or more valid 
# numeric reason IDs, each separated by a space.
# This field cannot be used with the RESOURCE or PRIORITY parameters
# in the same section.
# For a list of all available pending reason IDs, refer to the Reference
# at the end of this file.
# 
# RESOURCE is the name of the configured resource. Only one resource
# name is allowed and the resource name must be recognized by
# mbatchd. This field cannot be configured with REASON_ID in the
# same CustomPendingReason section.
#
# PRIORITY defines the priority of the resource in the range of
# 1 to 2147483646. The greater value has the higher priority. This
# field cannot be configured with REASON_ID in the same CustomPendingReason
# section.
#
# MESSAGE is the specified pending reason message that is displayed 
# when the job is pending. The custom pending reason message for the 
# configured REASON_ID is displayed when the job is pending and 
# matches the corresponding pending reason ID. The custom pending reason 
# message for the configured RESOURCE is displayed only when the job 
# is pending, it lacks the corresponding resource, and the pending 
# reason ID is PEND_HOST_JOB_RUSAGE(2601).
# Long lines of text may be wrapped using a backslash character (\) 
# to insert a line break.
# In vertical format, MESSAGE should be wrapped with parenthesis(), and
# parenthesis inside the message is not supported.
#
#
# Example 1: A custom message for a particular reason
#
# In this example, when the pending reason of a specific job is 
# PEND_JOB_START_FAIL(1603), PEND_JOB_START_UNKNWN(1604), 
# PEND_SBD_NO_MEM(1605), or PEND_SBD_NO_PROCESS(1606), this shows 
# that the job could not start on a specific host due to different 
# issues. In such a situation, the reason could tell users that they 
# can specify another host to get the job to run. The pending reason 
# message can be configured in either horizontal or vertical format,
# as follows:
# 
# Begin CustomPendingReason
# REASON_ID=1603 1604 1605 1606
# MESSAGE=There is a problem with the allocated host.\
# Try another host by running bmod -m 'host/hostgroup list'
# End CustomPendingReason
#
# Begin CustomPendingReason
# REASON_ID MESSAGE
# (1603 1604 1605 1606) (There is a problem with the allocated host.\
# Try another host by running bmod -m 'host/hostgroup list')
# End CustomPendingReason
#
#
# Example 2: A custom message and priority for a particular resource
#
# This section highlights the key resource "gpu" by setting its priority
# to 5. If a job is pending because multiple resources are not available,
# but "gpu" has the highest pending reason priority, lack of the "gpu"
# resource is mentioned as the single pending reason. Conversely, if
# there is a resource with a pending reason priority of 6 or higher,
# lack of the other resource is mentioned as the single pending reason,
# instead of lack of the "gpu" resource. The pending reason message can
# be configured in either horizontal or vertical format, as follows:
#
# Begin CustomPendingReason
# RESOURCE=gpu
# MESSAGE=All GPUs are in use.
# PRIORITY=5
# End CustomPendingReason
#
# Begin CustomPendingReason
# RESOURCE PRIORITY MESSAGE
# gpu 5 (All GPUs are in use.)
# End CustomPendingReason
